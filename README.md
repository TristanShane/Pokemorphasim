# Pokemorphasim
A small C# project demonstrating polymorphism and inheritance using a fun Pokémon-themed domain model.

The project models different Pokémon types (Fire, Water, etc.) using a shared abstract base class while allowing each type to implement its own behavior (e.g., unique attack logic). It also explores how object-oriented inheritance maps to database table strategies such as:

Table Per Hierarchy (TPH)

Table Per Type (TPT)

Table Per Concrete Type (TPC)

🎯 Learning Goals

Understand polymorphism in C#

Apply the Open/Closed Principle

Avoid conditional logic (if/else chains) using proper abstraction

See how OOP inheritance relates to relational database design

Practice clean, maintainable, SOLID-aligned code

🛠 Tech

C#

.NET

Basic OOP principles

Optional EF Core inheritance mapping
